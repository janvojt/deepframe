# Configuration for convolutional network designed to process the MNIST dataset
# and classify the digits. It is inspired by design of LeNet.
#
# Each line represents one layer, and contains configuration for this layer.
# Hash tag at the begining of the line indicates a comment, in which case the
# line is ignored by the configuration process.

# Convolutional layer with window size 5x5, multiplying features by 20
Convolution:5:20
Subsampling:2:2:false
Convolution:5:2
Subsampling:2:2:false
# Fully connected layer with 500 neurons, no bias
