# Configuration for a Deep Belief Network designed to process the MNIST dataset
# and classify the digits.
#
# Each line represents one layer, and contains configuration for this layer.
# Hash tag at the begining of the line indicates a comment, in which case the
# line is ignored by the configuration process.
#
# Input (Subsampling/pooling) layer with window size of 51x1,
# learning rate of 1

# Restricted Boltzmann Machine layer, with 150 hidden neurons,
# CD-1, learning rate 0.1,
# with bias
